Hi there. 

This CRUS app is created to mmimic a productivity tool I use called "The Productivity Planner". Users are able to add tasks in order of importance to their list and can then start a 25 minute timer to begin the task. Once the tasks are completed, you can either cross them off the list of delete them. 

Each day starts with a motivational quote to keep you motivated.
